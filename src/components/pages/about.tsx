                Saguenay is a social network designed to respect your privacy
                and promote the well-being of its users. Unlike many existing
                platforms, we don't monitor your activity to influence you or
                control what you see. In fact, Saguenay is algorithm-free:
                there's no sorting mechanism that selects posts for you, which
                means we don't know what you like, what you don't like, or what
                might capture your attention. Our users can enjoy an authentic
                online experience, where their interactions are neither
                monitored nor manipulated for commercial gain.

                Saguenay goes further to encourage healthy and balanced use of
                the platform. We've integrated a timer that alerts users when
                they're spending too much time on the network, to help them
                maintain moderate, mindful use. This wellness-focused approach
                is rare in social networking, where most platforms seek to
                extend your screen time to maximize revenue. At Saguenay,
                there's no advertising. Your data is not collected to target you
                with ads, nor is it sold to third parties. We take great care to
                ensure that your privacy is protected: there are no tracking
                devices, and we never share your personal information.

                Our commitment to security and content moderation is equally

                and banning users who post violent, pornographic or extremist
                content. Vulnerable users who violate our community guidelines
                are immediately sanctioned, ensuring a healthier and safer
                environment for all. In addition, the platform enables you to
                create or join groups based on your passions and interests,
                promoting authentic and enriching exchanges without fear of your
                data being exploited.

                nothing to hide, and allows the community to contribute to the
                continuous improvement of the platform. Unlike other social
                networks that exploit your personal data to maximize their

                are in control, without worrying about collecting data for
                profit. Our servers are hosted in the European Union and comply
